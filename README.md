# Human-like Face Generation with Progressive Training using TensorFlow Keras

This project focuses on generating human-like faces from random noise using a generative adversarial network (GAN) implemented in TensorFlow Keras. The model employs a progressive training approach, gradually increasing the complexity of both the generator and discriminator networks to produce higher quality images.

## Features

- Generation of human-like faces from random noise.
- Progressive training approach for smoother convergence and higher image quality.
- Data manually curated for diverse and high-quality facial features.
- Input and output images are in black and white format for simplicity and focus on facial structure.

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework for building and training neural networks.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.
- Functional API: A flexible way to define complex models in TensorFlow Keras.
- Python: Programming language used for development.
- NumPy: Python library used for numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: Python library used for data visualization.
